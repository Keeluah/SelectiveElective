These are the tables downloaded from our database,
as well as the Create Tables from our database.

We used pgAdmin4 and were not able to export everything together, so all
files are included per table.

Included is a screenshot from the pgAdmin4 browser as an insight
into the program we used for the database.

SQL Queries could not be exported from pgAdmin4, but are included in
Final Report PDF.


Thanks,
