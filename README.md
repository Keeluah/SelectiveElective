# SelectiveElective
Database assignment for University of Calgary
Collaborated work with Cristhian Sotelo, Katrina Chanco
Used to store and find a database of electives for universities, as well as store information for teachers to create electives listing and keeps a database for students to see what electives they have saved.
Used pgAdmin4 for the database and SQL Queries for the coding. 
Java, CSS and HTML were used to make the web app.
